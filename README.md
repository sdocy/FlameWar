The second project from my GrowWithGoogle / Udacity Anmroid Development Scholarship

A simple score counting app which introduced writing Java code to be run when buttons are
pressed and offered the opportunity to play with more complex, nested layout designs.

Some extra features I figured out on my own :

- semi-transparent buttons to allow the background to still be enjoyed, even with large buttons
- adding an Information ImageButton to provide a description of the app
- using a runnable to implement flashing scores when they are updated
- mixing RelativeLayout and LinearLayouts as needed for proper view placement
- enable the "Show Touches" developer option on Android to better show what is happening in the
  app when I capture a gif of it in action
