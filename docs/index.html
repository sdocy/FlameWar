	<p class="side-text">The second project from my GrowWithGoogle / Udacity Anroid Development Scholarship<br/><br/>
	A simple score counting app which introduced writing Java code to be run when buttons are<br/>
	pressed and offered the opportunity to play with more complex, nested layout designs.<br/><br/>
	Some extra features I figured out on my own :<br/>
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>semi-transparent buttons to allow the background to still be enjoyed, even with large buttons</li>
	<li>adding an Information ImageButton to provide a description of the app</li>
	<li>using a runnable to implement flashing scores when they are updated</li>
	
	<li>mixing RelativeLayout and LinearLayouts as needed for proper view placement</li>
	<li>enable the "Show Touches" developer option on Android to better show what is happening in the<br>
	    app when I capture a gif of it in action</li>
	</ul>
